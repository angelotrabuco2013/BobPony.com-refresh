# [BobPony.com][1] 
The new rewritten website with a more simplier look and more modular design for easy contributing and flexibility.

## Setup
First, you'll want to make sure you have Ruby installed.

Once you've got Ruby installed, you need to install Jekyll. Run the command `gem install bundler jekyll` in the site's directory. Once it completes, run the command `bundle exec jekyll serve`, and navigate to `localhost:4001` in your browser.

If everything worked properly, you should see the website running. If things don't work, search around on the internet, there should be solutions out there for your issue.

## Contributing

Feel free to contribute to this website, like fixing any spelling errors or any other errors that you encounter. 

Any fixes will gladly be accepted. Please contact me at contact(at)bobpony.org if you are interested in being a collaborator, then we'll talk about it.
